# ETF Forecasting

This project applies machine learning and statistical methods to forecast Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) prices. The dataset, provided by [Boris Marjanovic on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/borismarjanovic/etfs), includes historical ETF prices. This notebook utilizes a custom `ETF` class to simplify data analysis, modification, and model training.

## Features

- **Custom `ETF` class** for structured data handling and model training
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Implements models using PyTorch and scikit-learn
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates RÂ² and MSE for model evaluation
- **Data Visualization**: Plots for exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- scikit-learn
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
